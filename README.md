# Getting Started

Follow these steps to initialize the project:

---------------------
## Initializing

In order to initialize the project make sure to:
1. Run the postgerSQL server on port 5432 and create a database named "citizens". The DB credentials are stored in the application.properties file.
2. Run the project, you should not see any errors in IntelliJ console

So far the only route you can check is http://localhost:8080/citizens

## Initializing the React client

Open a terminal in *covid-19-app* and run `npm install` and then `npm start`. You should see the client running on http://localhost:3000.
